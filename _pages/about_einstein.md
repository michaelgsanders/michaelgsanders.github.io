As a Computer Science student at Cornell University, I am passionate about software development, problem solving, and machine learning. I am proficient in Java, JavaScript, Python, CSS, HTML, and R, and have experience with OCaml, Java Swing, and IntelliJ.

Currently, I am a member of CUSail's navigation subteam, where I design and test algorithms for an autonomous sailboat competing in SailBot, an international robotic sailing regatta. This project allows me to apply my skills and knowledge to a real-world challenge, as well as to collaborate with other talented and motivated students.

Through my education and work experience, I have developed core competencies in problem-solving, communication, teamwork, and creativity. I am eager to learn new technologies and frameworks, and to contribute to innovative and impactful projects. Please feel free to reach out at mgs264@cornell.edu
